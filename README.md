  - I like to explore the internals of programming languages, Runtimes, and compilers, and I have started with Python and JavaScript.
  - made some contribution(fixed bugs and added new feature in mmap,calendar,logging,enum) to [CPython](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Apython%2Fcpython+author%3AAgent-Hellboy+is%3Amerged&type=pullrequests) looking forward to javascript to understand it better.
  - I am broadening my programming language internals knowledge.
  - I love making tools and packages, doing Python, and go at work.
  - I like exploring backend web frameworks and looking forward to frontend frameworks 

### Handy Python libs, I have implemented

  - [log_call](https://github.com/Agent-Hellboy/log_call) library to log function or bond-method calls.
  - [google-chat-python-bot](https://github.com/Agent-Hellboy/google-chat-python-bot) piston-like python bot for Google chat. you can configure it in your Google Workspace and execute Python code in the chat window.
