  - I like to explore the internals of programming languages and I have started it with Python and javascript.
  - made some contribution(fixed bugs and added new feature in mmap,calendar,logging,enum) to [CPython](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Apython%2Fcpython+author%3AAgent-Hellboy+is%3Amerged&type=pullrequests) looking forward to javascript to understand it better.
  - I am broadening my knowledge of full-stack development. 
  - I love making tools and packages, doing python and go at work.

### Handy Python libs, I have implemented

  - [trace-dkey](https://github.com/Agent-Hellboy/trace-dkey) Python library to trace the path of a particular key inside a nested dict, used ast to statically find the key. 
  - [log_call](https://github.com/Agent-Hellboy/log_call) library to log function or bond-method calls.
  - [datatable-faker](https://pypi.org/project/datatable-faker/) Library to generate fake data class for unit test.
  - [google-chat-python-bot](https://github.com/Agent-Hellboy/google-chat-python-bot) piston-like python bot for Google chat. you can configure it in your Google Workspace and execute Python code in the chat window.


### Flask extensions, I have implemented and looking forward to making them more usable 

   - [flask-crlatency](https://github.com/Agent-Hellboy/flask-crlatency/) A flask extension to log route latency
   - [flask-json-db](https://github.com/Agent-Hellboy/flask-json-db) A flask extension to log a variable value inside view in a JSON file
   - [flask-starter](https://github.com/Agent-Hellboy/flask-starter) Set up a flask web app by running one command.
