# I'm Prince Roshan 👋🏾👨‍💻

  - I like to explore the internals of programming languages and I have started it with python and javascript.
  - I have worked with cryptography, access control, machine learning and full stack development till now.
  - I am broadening my knowledge of full stack development. 
  - I love making tools and packages. 

  - I am solving DSA problem in python these days so I may came up with tools to visualise program execution.
